## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Install Prompt Not Showing
- **Cause**: Browser doesn't support PWA or app already installed
- **Solution**: Check if app is already installed, clear browser data, or use manual installation

#### Service Worker Not Registering
- **Cause**: HTTPS required, or browser doesn't support service workers
- **Solution**: Ensure site is served over HTTPS, check browser compatibility

#### Icons Not Loading
- **Cause**: Missing icon files or incorrect paths
- **Solution**: Verify all icon files exist in `/public` directory

#### Offline Page Not Showing
- **Cause**: Service worker not caching offline page
- **Solution**: Check service worker registration and cache strategies

### Debug Commands

```javascript
// Check service worker status
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(registrations => {
  console.log('Service Workers:', registrations);
});

// Check if app is installed
if (window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches) {
  console.log('App is installed');
}

// Check PWA installability
window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', (e) => {
  console.log('PWA can be installed');
});
```
